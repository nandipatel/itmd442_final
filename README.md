## Project Description:

A full stack CRUD application, an employee management application.

## Development Environment:

To develop this application the three main frameworks I used were NodeJS, ExpressJs, and MongoDB. The computer I used to work on the application was a Macbook Pro 2019, running Ventura 13.3.1. To write and edit the application code I used Visual Studio Code, version 1.77.3.

- Node version: 16.13.0

- Express version: 4.18.2

- MongoDB version: 7.1.0

## Installation/Running Instructions:

In the terminal enter the following commands:

1. npm i --force
2. npm start

Include any instructions on how to get the project up and running. Assume someone that doesn’t know how to run an Express or Node JS application. Give the steps from a cloned repository to install dependencies and start the application.

## Insights and Results:

Include here things you learned, challenges or problems you faced, and any details about the results you received. If you couldn’t get something working this would be the place to describe what you tried and what wouldn’t work. Feel free to embed screenshots for working and non-working features.

## References:

As I had a difficult time getting some of the CRUD functions to work, I used this tutorial to guide me through the process.
