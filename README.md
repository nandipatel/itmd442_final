## Project Description:

A full stack CRUD application, an employee management application.

## Development Environment:

To develop this application the three main frameworks I used were NodeJS, ExpressJs, and MongoDB. The computer I used to work on the application was a Macbook Pro 2019, running Ventura 13.3.1. To write and edit the application code I used Visual Studio Code, version 1.77.3.

- Node version: 16.13.0

- Express version: 4.18.2

- MongoDB version: 7.1.0

## Installation/Running Instructions:

In the terminal enter the following commands:

1. npm i --force
2. npm start

## Insights and Results:

While using the tutorial helped me understand how files and routes are connected, some parts got a little complicated as I was trying to adjust to based on what I wanted my application to do. I think I can better understand how a full-stack application is connected, and I was able to get more experience with express and ejs. I didn't make it as far as I would have liked, but I was able to get further and make more progress from the past labs. Additionally, while I had the base code to assist me in writing my application, I was able to dig deep and figure out why certain features weren't working, and how to fix and solve various problems.

## References:

As I had a difficult time getting some of the CRUD functions to work, I used this tutorial to guide me through the process. For styling, I used the tutorial's general styling and framework and adjusted from there.
